# thombot

written in python using discord.py

Made this bot for the discord server me and my friends use. It doesn't do a lot right now and I am still learning a lot about how to write well. Just keeping this here so I have another place to keep track of it. probably wont be the most updated version until I get better about commits and stuff, since I'm always tweaking it a bit.
