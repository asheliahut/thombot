# thombot

Bot made for the Thom Stargazer Memorial Guild server.

commands:

!cat posts a random cat image to the channel

!bothelp posts some basic bot info and commands(outdated)

!harambe posts a random picture of harambe

!ostats (battletag) posts a link to the ostats page of the battletag provided

!sombra important sombra information

!aliens posts aliens guy I think, honestly don't know someone asked me to add it.

!slab RETURN THE SLAAAAB

The bot also posts a message when someone joins and sometimes random stuff like saying "Merry Christmas!".
Currently sets the game itself in the bot code, might add a command later to change the currently playing game.
Need to update help file, lots of old info and outdated stuff. Might have it send a private message to the person to uses the command instead posting it in the channel.

always looking for new and fun things to add.(and dumb things too)
